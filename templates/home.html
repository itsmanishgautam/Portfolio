            <p>
                I've independently completed several projects
                using Django, learning from YouTube  tutorials.
                I have a basic understanding of models, views, 
                templates, and working with SQLite databases.
                <br><br>
                Using VS Code, I'm capable of developing
                simple web applications.

                You can explore my projects in the "Projects" tab for further insight.
